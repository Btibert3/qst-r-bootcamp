# About

Repo for the tooling needed for R bootcamps at BU's Questrom School of Business.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Btibert3/qst-r-bootcamp/master)

> With the inclusion of RStudio below, will need to rebuild the Binder just in case the commands broke the setup.


## RStudio Cloud

The clone doesn't install, so to create an environment that can be shared, once the project is spun up (in your private repo)

```
source("install.R")
```

The code above will install all of the packages, but this will be your environment moving forward.
